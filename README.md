To experiment with new ways of interactive program verification, we develop this user interface.
It is a graphical proof front end for programs written and specified in Dafny.

The tool is written in Java.

## Requirements

* Java (at least 8) must be installed.
* ANT must be installed

## Run it

After downloading run `ant jar` in the project  directory to build the tools.
Then call `java -jar algover.jar` to run it.

An example can be found ... TODO

## Infrastructure

* Jenkins CI server: http://hudson.se.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/job/AlgoVer-WT/ (no feedback to this page yet)

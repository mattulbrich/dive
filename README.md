To experiment with new ways of interactive program verification, we develop this user interface.
It is a graphical proof front end for programs written and specified in Dafny.

The tool is written in Java.

## Requirements

* ANT must be installed

## Run it

After downloading run `ant jar` in the project  directory to build the tools.
Then call `java -jar algover.jar` to run it.

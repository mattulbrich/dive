# Protocol 29 Nov 18

## Suggestion:

Prepare a `.md` file lisiting the capabilities and limitations of AlgoVer.
Explain workarounds where possible

## Questions:
- why rule `TimesOneRule`? Should that not be a rule defined in Dafny as a lemma?

## Meeting results:
- goal labels in editor still buggy
- font size for algover
  - in css with .root for all fonts changeable
  - annotated for specific fonts
  - maybe cmdline option for "beamer-mode"
  - should be dynamically changeable in the program
- MatchingTerms in Script still buggy
- RulePane is worse than in KeY. Some sort of filtering sorting is necessary
- SkolemizationRuleBug should be fixed by now
